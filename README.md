# Shape-Tools

Introduction:

In this lab you will use the Java you have learned in lecture to write a small program.
You will apply what you know about event handling, the realization and association
relationships, accessor and mutator methods, and the manipulation of instance
variables to complete a small program which lets you draw shapes using different
“shape tools”. In this lab we also include a brief discussion of design patterns.

What you are given:

In this lab you are given a project with several skeletal classes, arranged into
packages to keep things organized. The lab6.tools package contains one complete
interface, ITool, and six skeletal classes. The lab6.listeners package contains two
skeletal classes. Finally, the lab6 package contains just one class, Lab6, which
represents the overall system. This class is partially defined – do not modify or
remove any of the code it contains, just add new code to it in the area specified.
You must define the classes so that the program behaves just like the demo. The
shapes drawn do not have to have the same color or size, but the shapes should be
visible, and the colors unique.
